Linux is a free and open-source software (FOSS) operating systems built around the Linux kernel, packaged in a distro, by Linus Torvalds.

The main distros for the Entreprise Servers are the Red Hat *RHEL*, Suse *SLES* (based on Slackware) and *Ubuntu Server* (based on Debian). There is also the community version of RHEL, *CentOS*, *Debian* and *Oracle Linux* (based on RHEL, but with Oracle Support).

For desktop, the most common are probably fedora or ubuntu distros, but there are too manny, for different proposes, such as Lubuntu, that works really well on old computers.
