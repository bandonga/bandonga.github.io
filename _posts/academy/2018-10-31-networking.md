### Certification

If you wish to get certified, the standard is by [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html). We recomend to start with the [CCNA RS](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna/) certification and follow our **[guide](/CCNA/0-start/)**. As an alternative, you can check the [comptia](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/network) and [juniper](https://www.juniper.net/uk/en/training/certification/certification-tracks/ent-routing-switching-track/) certification programs.

* [CCNA](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccna/) Routing and Switching
* [CCNP](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccnp/) Routing and Switching
* [CCIE](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/community/certifications/ccie_routing_switching) Routing and Switching

Another extra possibility is the [wireshark](https://www.wiresharktraining.com/certification.html) certification.
A good way to **renew** your cisco professional  certificates is the [tshoot](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/tshoot2.html) exam.
