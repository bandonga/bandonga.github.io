### Modules


Cisco calls their StackWise cable. That combines multiple switches into a single brain. Normally, if you're talking about stackable switches, you're talking about, I manage that one individually and that one and that one.

switch: central connection point for devices plugging into the network.
A layer 3 switch is where it does routing in the hardware. Here's the magic sauce of a switch. They've created special chips that go inside of there called ASIC, Application-Specific Integrated Circuitry.

What that does is allow it to see stuff, like MAC addresses, and operate on it and take action on it just as fast as the cable can transmit. So the ASIC allow the switch to work as fast as that cable can send data. It's as if the switch wasn't there.

And it can do that same thing for routing. So a layer 3 switch can route just as fast as the cable can send. But there's an exception. You can only do so much in hardware before you reach how much intelligence you can pack into a chip, and that's where the router comes in.

Routers are software based, which means they have a bajillion features. They can do all kinds of stuff. But they're never going to be as fast as you could be if you could do it in a hardware. So there's your trade-off. Layer 3 switch-- typically, less features but way faster than a router that has way more features, but it runs a little slow.

hub: 1st generation: device used to generate and repeat signals. receives the signal from a port and send to every port

bridge: 2nd generation. Learns the MAC address.
