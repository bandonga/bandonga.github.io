collision or broadcast domain

Internetworking is "the concept of interconnecting different types of networks to build a large, global network"[1]:169 such that any pair of connected hosts can exchange packets. To build an internetwork, the following are needed:[2]:103 A standardized scheme to address packets to any host on any participating network; a standardized protocol defining format and handling of transmitted packets; components interconnecting the participating networks by routing packets to their destinations based on standardized addresses.

A broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network, in which all nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.

In terms of current popular technologies, any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or switch is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. Routers and other higher-layer devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.

This is as compared to a collision domain, which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.

While some layer two network devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating VLANs divides broadcast domains as well.

**Collision domain** is an Ethernet term used to describe a network scenario in which one device sends a packet out on a network segment and every other device on that same segment is forced to pay attention no matter what. This isn’t very efficient because if a different device tries to transmit at the same time, a collision will occur, requiring both devices to retransmit, one at a time—not good! This happens a lot in a hub environment, where each host segment connects to a hub that represents only one collision domain and a single broadcast domain. By contrast, each and every port on a switch represents its own collision domain, allowing network traffic to flow much more smoothly.

A collision domain is a network segment connected by a shared medium or through repeaters where simultaneous data transmissions collide with one another. The collision domain applies particularly in wireless networks, but also affected early versions of Ethernet. A network collision occurs when more than one device attempts to send a packet on a network segment at the same time. Members of a collision domain may be involved in collisions with one another. Devices outside the collision domain do not have collisions with those inside.

Only one device in the collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other devices in the domain listen to the network and refrain from transmitting while others are already transmitting in order to avoid collisions. Because only one device may be transmitting at any one time, total network bandwidth is shared among all devices on the collision domain. Collisions also decrease network efficiency on a collision domain as collisions require devices to abort transmission and retransmit at a later time.

Since data bits are propagated at a finite speed, simultaneously is to be defined in terms of the size of the collision domain and the minimum packet size allowed. A smaller packet size or a larger dimension would make it possible for a sender to finish sending the packet without the first bits of the message being able to reach the most remote node. So, that node could start sending as well, without a clue to the transmission already taking place and destroying the first packet. Unless the size of the collision domain allows the initial sender to receive the second transmission attempt – the collision – within the time it takes to send the packet he would neither be able to detect the collision nor to repeat the transmission – this is called a late collision.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A computer network, or data network, is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections (data links) between nodes. These data links are established over cable media such as wires or optic cables, or wireless media such as WiFi.

Α network is simply defined as something that connects things together for
a specific purpose. The term network is used in a variety of contexts,
including telephone, television, computer, or even people networks.
A computer network connects two or more devices together to share a
nearly limitless range of information and services


An internetwork is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers.


#### Network Devices


> Switches create separate collision domains within a single broadcast domain.
Routers provide a separate broadcast domain for each interface.

**hub** - Ethernet (repeater) hub is a network device  in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical layer and can participate in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision, but don’t segment a network, just connect network segments. using hubs in your Ethernet network can contribute to congestion


A bridge is a device that creates a single aggregate network from network segments. This function is called network bridging. Bridging is distinct from routing. Routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate, whereas bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network. In the OSI model, bridging is performed in the data link layer (layer 2). If one or more segments of the bridged network are wireless, the device is known as a wireless bridge.

The term bridging was introduced before routers and switches were implemented, so it’s pretty
common to hear people referring to switches as bridges. That’s because bridges and switches
basically do the same thing—break up collision domains on a LAN. Note to self that you cannot
buy a physical bridge these days, only LAN switches, which use bridging technologies. This does
not mean that you won’t still hear Cisco and others refer to LAN switches as multiport bridges
now and then. bridges/switches are used to segment networks, but they
will not isolate broadcast or multicast packets.




**switches** we don’t use layer 2 switches to create internetworks because they don’t break up
broadcast domains by default. Instead, they’re employed to add functionality to a network LAN.
The main purpose of these switches is to make a LAN work better—to optimize its performance, providing more bandwidth for the LAN’s users. Also, these switches don’t forward packets to other networks like routers do. Instead, they only "switch" frames from one port to another within the switched network.

 **routers** by default, are basically employed to efficiently break up a broadcast domain. why breaking up a broadcast domain is so important: When a host or server sends a network broadcast, every device on the network must read and process that broadcast—unless you have a router.
The router discard the broadcast without forwarding it on to other networks. Even though routers are known for breaking up broadcast
domains by default, it’s important to remember that they break up collision domains as well.
There are two advantages to using routers in your network:
They don’t forward broadcasts by default.
They can filter the network based on layer 3 (Network layer) information such as an IP
address.


Router functions in your network
* think of routers as layer 3 switches. Unlike plain-vanilla layer 2 switches, which forward or filter frames, routers use logical addressing and provide an important capacity called **packet switching**.
* Routers can also provide **packet filtering** via access lists,
* and when routers connect two or more networks together and use logical addressing (IP or IPv6), you then have an **internetwork**.
* Finally, routers use a routing table, which is essentially a map of the internetwork, to make best **path selections** for getting data to its proper destination and properly forward packets to remote networks.


Firewalls: These devices are network security systems that monitor and control the incoming
and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules, and is usually an
Intrusion Protection System (IPS). Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) firewall
typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and the Internet,
which is not secure or trusted. Cisco’s new acquisition of Sourcefire put them in the top of the
market with Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW) and Next Generation IPS (NGIPS), which
Cisco now just calls Firepower. Cisco new Firepower runs on dedicated appliances, Cisco’s
ASA’s, ISR routers and even on Meraki products.

WLAN Controllers: These are the devices that network administrators or network operations
centers use to manage access points in medium to large to extremely large quantities. TheWLAN controller automatically handles the configuration of wireless access points and was
typically used only in larger enterprise systems. However, with Cisco’s acquisition of Meraki
systems, you can easily manage a small to medium sized wireless network via the cloud using
their simple to configure web controller system.

WLAN devices: These devices connect wireless devices such as computers, printers, and
tablets to the network. Since pretty much every device manufactured today has a wireless
NIC, you just need to configure a basic access point (AP) to connect to a traditional wired
network.

Access Points or APs: These devices allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network and
extend a collision domain from a switch, and are typically in their own broadcast domain or
what we’ll refer to as a Virtual LAN (VLAN). An AP can be a simple standalone device, but
today they are usually managed by wireless controllers either in house or through the
internet.


##### Modem
A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a network hardware device that modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with any means of transmitting analogue signals, from light emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.

##### Router
A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its destination node

##### Switch
A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. Unlike less advanced network hubs, a network switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive it, rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of its ports.

##### AP
In computer networking, a wireless access point (WAP) is a networking hardware device that allows a Wi-Fi compliant device to connect to a wired network. The WAP usually connects to a router (via a wired network) as a standalone device, but it can also be an integral component of the router itself. A WAP is differentiated from a hotspot, which is the physical location where Wi-Fi access to a WLAN is available.

#### Network topology

#### Communication protocols

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### Internetworking Models

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to allow communication with computers from different manufacturers.

### OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.

Layer           | Protocol data unit (PDU)       | Internet model            | SS7
----------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------
7 Application   | Data                           | Application (eg. http)    | Application
6 Presentation  | Data                           | Application (eg. ssl)     |
5 Session       | Data                           | Application (eg. Sockets) |
4 Transport     | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) | Transport                 |
3 Network       | Packet                         | Internet / Internetwork   | MTP Level 3
2 Data link     | Frame                          | Link / Network interface  | MTP Level 2
1 Physical      | Bit                            |                           | MTP Level 1


#### Internet protocol suite
The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the original protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received. This functionality is organised into four abstraction layers which are used to sort all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved

#### Encapsulation

![UDP encapsulation](images/UDP_encapsulation.png)

The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received. This functionality is organised into four abstraction layers which are used to sort all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved.[1][2] From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, connecting independent networks, thus providing internetworking; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.

##### Ethernet Frame

An Ethernet frame is preceded by a preamble and start frame delimiter (SFD), which are both part of the Ethernet packet at the physical layer. Each Ethernet frame starts with an Ethernet header, which contains destination and source MAC addresses as its first two fields. The middle section of the frame is payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a frame check sequence (FCS), which is a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check used to detect any in-transit corruption of data.

#### 802.1Q

IEEE 802.1Q is the networking standard that supports virtual LANs (VLANs) on an Ethernet network. The standard defines a system of VLAN tagging for Ethernet frames and the accompanying procedures to be used by bridges and switches in handling such frames.

Portions of the network which are VLAN-aware (i.e., IEEE 802.1Q conformant) can include VLAN tags. When a frame enters the VLAN-aware portion of the network, a tag is added to represent the VLAN membership of the frame's port or the port/protocol combination, depending on whether port-based or port-and-protocol-based VLAN classification is being used. Each frame must be distinguishable as being within exactly one VLAN. A frame in the VLAN-aware portion of the network that does not contain a VLAN tag is assumed to be flowing on the native VLAN.

##### TCP/UDP
Both TCP and UDP are protocols used for sending bits of data – known as packets –- over the internet. They both build on top of the internet protocol. In other words, whether you're sending a packet via TCP or UDP, that packet is sent to an IP address. These packets are treated similarly, as they're forwarded from your computer to intermediary routers and on to the destination.

#####  How does TCP work?

When visiting a website, your computer sends out TCP requests to a web server, asking for the website. The web server responds by sending over TCP packets for that website. The packets will then come together to create the website before you.
Why is TCP important?

The most important part of TCP is that it involves two way communication between the computer and the server. It guarantees, through a series of acknowledgements, that the packets are successfully delivered before you. After a series of packets are sent, each of them numbered, an acknowledgment is requested from the server. The receiver then sends back an acknowledgment, telling the server that the packets were received, retransmission is not necessary, and the next set of packets can be sent over. This continues until all the packets are successfully sent over.
If the receiver does not receive the packets, or the packets are corrupted, then the sender will resend them. If the sender does not receive acknowledgment for a set of packets within a specific period of time, then it will resend those packets, again awaiting a response.

Why do we use TCP?

We use TCP when we want to guarantee that packets of data will be sent and received successfully through a series of acknowledgements
examples include: websites, file transfers/downloads
TCP gives you flow control; TCP will try and buffer the data dependent upon the available bandwidth. Because those applications that use TCP typically do not care about the order of packets, packets sent using TCP can be sent whenever the LAN/WAN can allow for it. UDP, as a result of it being connectionless (communication between two network end points in which a message can be sent from one end point to another without prior arrangement), is put on the network and sent out with little regard.

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol.

##### How does UDP work?

It is essentially the same as TCP but without the checks, acknowledgements, and retransmissions – You lose a packet? Too bad!
Why do we use UDP?

Acknowledgements/retransmissions take time and slow things down. Certain packets on the internet do not or should not require TCP or retransmission as it would either slow things down or would render the packet transfer worthless
ie: voice, video streaming,
If VOIP were to use TCP and packets were dropped and thus retransmitted, you would experience a call in which missing audio in one section of the call would then reappear during another part of the call.


##### Ports/Firewall

What is a firewall?
Firewalls are physical or virtual constructs that monitor and control the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. These can be firewalls for the entire network, or software firewalls on individual devices.
Originally you could either drop or allow packets to traverse a firewall. Now firewalls have the ability to block or allow applications, detect viruses, and prevent malicious content from entering the network.
What is a port?

A port is a software construct that identifies a specific service or process. Because servers on the internet are used for a multitude of things, the port identifies the type of service or process that’s being requested. The server receives a request on a specific port and thus knows what service is required.
There are ports for email, web traffic, file transfer, etc. UDP/TCP packets will specify the source and destination of ports
Why are ports open/closed?

Open ports will allow UDP/TCP traffic to go through the router/firewall. If the ports are closed, then it will reject connections or ignore packets directed at it. Open ports do not necessarily mean that packets will traverse through. There needs to be an application that still accepts and listens to those packets. Firewalls/routers can close ports, causing those packets coming in on those ports to be filtered out and dropped.
Security IT teams will often close ports that they do not plan to use to prevent hackers from obtaining access/sending malicious software.

##### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

VPN secures your computer's internet connection to guarantee that all of the data you're sending and receiving is encrypted and secured from prying eyes.
More often than not, you will see customers using either a Site-to-Site VPN or a Remote Access VPN tunnel
What is Site-to-Site VPN?
It allows offices in multiple fixed locations to establish secure connections with each other over a public network (ie: the Internet).
It extends the company's network, making computer resources from one location available to employees at other locations.
What is Remote Access VPN?
Allows an individual user to connect to a private business network from a remote location using a laptop or desktop computer connected to the Internet. Most customers will likely be using remote access VPN.
Remote Access VPN requires a VPN client that resides on the device to securely establish the tunnel and provide with authentication and authorization of the user onto the internal network.

##### Full Tunneling
takes all traffic, including traffic destined for the private network and traffic destined for the Internet, and routes it through the VPN tunnel to the internal network. This means that traffic, such as Talkdesk traffic, will first be routed through the VPN tunnel to the private business network before being sent out to the Internet and its final destination.
Split Tunneling routes only some traffic through the VPN tunnel to the private network. Only traffic that is destined for the internal network will be routed through the tunnel. All other traffic destined for the Internet will route directly to the Internet.
What does this mean for our customers?
Our general recommendation for using Talkdesk is to not send Talkdesk/Twilio traffic through VPN tunnels. VPN / remote login may rely upon the local audio drivers for whatever machine you're connecting to, thus the audio of the agent's machine may not be accessed, and, therefore, may not be transmitted.
There may be some possibility of setting up exception/exclusion lists but it is not advised nor are we able to assist in support or troubleshooting VPN.
Our general recommendation is to split-tunnel, and allow Talkdesk/Twilio traffic to be directed out to the internet instead of through the VPN tunnel. Even if audio were to work, there could be some delays in the audio if it's being rerouted through the internal network first.

##### Multihoming
**Multihoming** is the practice of connecting a host or a computer network to more than one network. This can be done in order to increase reliability or performance.

##### NAT
**NAT** (Network address translation) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.[1] The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network.
* https://www.karlrupp.net/en/computer/nat_tutorial

##### Multicast
In computer networking, multicast is group communication[1] where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously. Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many distribution. Multicast should not be confused with physical layer point-to-multipoint communication.
IP multicast is a technique for one-to-many communication over an IP network. The destination nodes send Internet Group Management Protocol join and leave messages, for example in the case of IPTV when the user changes from one TV channel to another. IP multicast scales to a larger receiver population by not requiring prior knowledge of who or how many receivers there are. Multicast uses network infrastructure efficiently by requiring the source to send a packet only once, even if it needs to be delivered to a large number of receivers. The nodes in the network take care of replicating the packet to reach multiple receivers only when necessary.
The most common transport layer protocol to use multicast addressing is User Datagram Protocol (UDP). By its nature, UDP is not reliable—messages may be lost or delivered out of order. By adding loss detection and re-transmission mechanisms, reliable multicast has been implemented on top of UDP or IP


##### rfc

Private IP addresses would be one (RFC 1918) http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/RFC-1918

This has an effect on NAT, which is talked about in RFC 1631 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1631
It is important to know RFC 1518 as well (CIDR)

#### VLAN

A VLAN (virtual LAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2).

VLANs work by applying and handling tags to network packets, allowing networks and devices that must be kept separate to share the same physical cabling without interacting

In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed.

VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if they are not directly connected to the same switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly simplify network design and deployment.
Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs necessitates the labor of relocating nodes or rewiring data links.

To subdivide a network into VLANs network equipment can be confirured to partition only per physical port, in which case each VLAN is connected with a dedicated network cable. Another optionis to mark frames through VLAN tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs. Since VLANs share bandwidth, a VLAN trunk can use link aggregation or QoS prioritization to route data efficiently.

VLANs, which are used when you logically break up broadcast domains in
a layer 2, switched network. It’s really important to understand that even in a switched network
environment, you still need a router to provide communication between VLANs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is an abbreviation for local area network.

To subdivide a network into virtual LANs, one configures network equipment. Simpler equipment can partition only per physical port (if at all), in which case each VLAN is connected with a dedicated network cable. More sophisticated devices can mark frames through VLAN tagging, so that a single interconnect (trunk) may be used to transport data for multiple VLANs. Since VLANs share bandwidth, a VLAN trunk can use link aggregation, quality-of-service prioritisation, or both to route data efficiently.

VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not on the same network switch. This can greatly simplify network design and deployment because VLAN membership can be configured through software. Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs necessitates the labour of relocating nodes or rewiring data links.


VLANs address issues such as scalability, security, and network management. Network architects set up VLANs to provide network segmentation. Routers between VLANs filter broadcast traffic, enhance network security, perform address summarization, and mitigate network congestion.

In a network utilizing broadcasts for service discovery, address assignment and resolution and other services, as the number of peers on a network grows, the frequency of broadcasts also increases. VLANs can help manage broadcast traffic by forming multiple broadcast domains. Breaking up a large network into smaller independent segments reduces the amount of broadcast traffic each network device and network segment has to bear. Switches may not bridge network traffic between VLANs, as doing so would violate the integrity of the VLAN broadcast domain.

VLANs can also help create multiple layer 3 networks on a single physical infrastructure. VLANs are data link layer (OSI layer 2) constructs, analogous to Internet Protocol (IP) subnets, which are network layer (OSI layer 3) constructs. In an environment employing VLANs, a one-to-one relationship often exists between VLANs and IP subnets, although it is possible to have multiple subnets on one VLAN.

Without VLAN capability, users are assigned to networks based on geography and are limited by physical topologies and distances. VLANs can logically group networks to decouple the users' network location from their physical location. By using VLANs, one can control traffic patterns and react quickly to employee or equipment relocations. VLANs provide the flexibility to adapt to changes in network requirements and allow for simplified administration.
