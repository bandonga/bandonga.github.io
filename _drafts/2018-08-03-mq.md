### Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)

*Message Oriented Middleware* (MOM) makes use of messaging provider to mediate messaging operations between distributed systems.

The basic elements of a MOM system are clients, messages, and the MOM provider, which includes an API and administrative tools.
A client makes an API call to send a message to a destination managed by the provider. The provider services route and deliver the message, retaining the message until a receiving client retrieves it.

The messaging provider have administrative tools, to monitor and tune performance. Since it's an asynchronous system, the clients can continue to load work and can use all resources, failing the message handling.

The MOM provider uses different architectures to route and deliver messages: it can use a centralized message server or it can distribute routing and delivery functions to each client machine. Some MOM products combine these two approaches.

### JMS as a MOM Standard
The Java Messaging Service specification was developed to allow Java applications access to existing **[MOM]([JMS]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /academy/2018-05-28-basic-sysadmin#MOM %}))** systems, following essential elements of existing messaging systems:
* The concept of a *messaging provider* that routes and delivers messages
* Support for reliable message delivery
* Distinct messaging patterns or domains such as point-to-point messaging and publish/subscribe messaging
* Facilities for pushing messages to message consumers (asynchronous receipt) and having them pulled by message consumers (synchronous receipt).
* Common message formats such as stream, text, and byte

Vendors implement the JMS specification by supplying a JMS provider consisting of libraries that implement the JMS interfaces, of functionality for routing and delivering messages, and of administrative tools that manage, monitor, and tune the messaging service. Routing and delivery functions can be performed by a centralized message server, or they can be implemented through functionality that is part of each client’s runtime.

Equally, a JMS provider can play a variety of roles: it can be created as a stand-alone product or as an embedded component in a larger distributed runtime system.

As a standalone product, it could be used to define the backbone of an enterprise application integration system; embedded in an application server, it could support inter-component messaging. For example, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) uses a JMS provider to implement message-driven beans and to allow EJB components to send and receive messages asynchronously.

To have created a standard that included all features of existing systems would have resulted in a system that was hard to learn and difficult to implement. Instead, JMS defined a least common denominator of messaging concepts and features. This resulted in a standard that is easy to learn and that maximizes the portability of JMS applications across JMS providers. It’s important to note that JMS is an API standard, not a protocol standard. Because all JMS clients implement the same interface, it is easy to port one vendor's clinet to another vendor's JMS provide implementation. But different JMS vendors typically cannot communicate directly with one another.
