A guide to help you know more about WebRTC.

###### Introduction

WebRTC offers real time communication to send media  natively from a web-browser.
Is also a media engine with standardize javascript APIs, handled by the IETF and W3C

webrtc.org is a open source project (software stack) that holds an implementation of the specification.

Needs clients and servers.

Main APIs
* `getUserMedia` acquires the audio and video media (by accessing a device's camera, screen or microphone).
* `RTCPeerConnection` enables audio and video communication between peers. It performs signal processing, codec handling, peer-to-peer communication, security, encoding, NAT  and bandwidth management.
* `RTCDataChannel` allows bidirectional communication of arbitrary data between peers. It uses the same API as WebSockets and has very low latency.

The WebRTC API also includes a statistics function:
`getStats` allows the web application to retrieve a set of statistics about WebRTC sessions.

##### Browser architecture
Browser
Browser Engine > chromium  and has the implementation of WebRTC
Renderer Blink: Fork of webkit
Runtime Javascript V8
