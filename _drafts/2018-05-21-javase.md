### Java SE

##### Java SE
**Java SE** (Standard Edition) is the core Java programming platform. It contains all of the libraries and APIs. It includes a compiler, a debugger, and a JVM.

The **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) is a software machine that converts compiled Java code into the machine code of the platform on which the virtual machine runs. Because Java source code is compiled into the code that runs on the virtual machine, that compiled code is portable. JVM Tuning can significantly affect WLS performance.
WebLogic Server, as Java code itself, runs within a JVM. The JVMs available from Oracle are:
* Oracle JRockit JVM
* Oracle Hotspot JVM

### JDBC

The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API is a platform and vendor-independent mechanism, using Java code for accessing and using a database SQL and is oriented towards relational databases. It builds on ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and Data source objects are configured to provide database access.
* Using JDBC, a Java app can access virtually any relational database, with the same code and run on any platform with a JVM.
* JDBC accomplishes database connections by using a driver mechanism that translates the JDBC calls to native database calls.

DB vendors provide a driver that enables their products to be accessible using Java technology. Applications running on a JVM are capable of accessing any data store, on any platform, for which there is a JDBC driver, but do not directly use JDBC drivers though. In order to access data stores, applications interact directly with a higher-level JDBC concept, the data source, and with its related objects. Data sources then use the underlying driver to translate JDBC calls into native data store calls.

#### Drivers

* Type 1 - JDBC-ODBC Bridge (bridge) - Translates all JDBC calls into ODBC calls.
* Type 2 - Native API (native) - Translates all JDBC calls into native API database calls. (e.g: DLL on windows using JNI)
* Type 3 - Network Protocol(middleware) - Translates all JDBC calls into database independent middleware specific calls.
* Type 4 - Native Protocol(pure java thin) - Translates all JDBC calls directly into database calls.

### Establishing a Connection
First, you need to establish a connection with the data source you want to use. A data source can be a DBMS, a legacy file system, or some other source of data with a corresponding JDBC driver. Typically, a JDBC application connects to a target data source using one of two classes:

DataSource objects that implement connection pooling also produce a connection to the particular data source that the DataSource class represents. The connection object that the getConnection method returns is a handle to a PooledConnection object rather than a physical connection. An application uses the connection object in the same way that it uses a connection. Connection pooling has no effect on application code except that a pooled connection, like all connections, should always be explicitly closed. When an application closes a connection that is pooled, the connection is returned to a pool of reusable connections. The next time getConnection is called, a handle to one of these pooled connections will be returned if one is available. Because connection pooling avoids creating a new physical connection every time one is requested, applications can run significantly faster.

A JDBC connection pool is a group of reusable connections for a particular database. Because creating each new physical connection is time consuming, the server maintains a pool of available connections to increase performance. When it requests a connection, an application obtains one from the pool. When an application closes a connection, the connection is returned to the pool.

DriverManager: This fully implemented class connects an application to a data source, which is specified by a database URL. When this class first attempts to establish a connection, it automatically loads any JDBC 4.0 drivers found within the class path. Note that your application must manually load any JDBC drivers prior to version 4.0.

DataSource: This interface is preferred over DriverManager because it allows details about the underlying data source to be transparent to your application. A DataSource object's properties are set so that it represents a particular data source.

### JNDI

JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is an API for accessing directory or naming services, independent of any specific service implementation.

JNDI provides the main naming and directory service used by all Java EE resources, applications, and
clients. Not only can developers use JNDI to locate the various objects and services registered in
various Java EE services, but also they can register their own objects with the JNDI tree.

JNDI is a standard Java EE mechanism that clients can use to publish, locate, and retrieve objects to access
naming and directory servers. In order to locate various objects, you first bind them to a distributed
directory service using JNDI. Clients then locate and retrieve those objects from the JNDI tree. For
example, when you deploy an EJB, it’s bound to a JNDI name and made available in the global JNDI
tree. The same is true of any services such as a JDBC data source. Java clients use these JNDI names to
gain access to the resource. You can bind all Java EE resources such as JTA transactions, JDBC data
connections, JMS connection factories, and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) objects in the JNDI tree.

JNDI is hierarchical in structure—it represents a hierarchy of context objects. Objects are bound into and retrieved from a specific context in that hierarchy. The root of that hierarchy for a given user is InitialContext and is acquired in a context-sensitive way.

JNDI uses an open architecture that allows different implementations of directory services. These implementations map JNDI calls to their implementation of the directory services.

* **JavaBeans** are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean) and implements object serialisation or externalisation. It is  low-level approach to develop  reusable software components that can be used for building different types of Java applications

* A **bean** is a serializable object.  A Java object is serializable if its class or any of its superclasses implements either the java.io.Serializable interface or its subinterface, java.io.Externalizable. Have a zero-argument constructor, and allow access to properties using getter and setter methods. This standard aims to create reusable software components for Java.
* **Serialization** is the process of converting the current state of Object into stream of bytes so that can be reverted into a copy of the object. An important thing to note here is byte stream create is  platform neutral where the object which is created in one system can be deserialised in another system.

The JMX (Java Management Extensions) is a Java technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices and service-oriented networks. Those resources are represented by objects called MBeans. In the API, classes can be dynamically loaded and instantiated.

WebLogic Server provides a large set of MBeans for the resources that it manages. These objects are used by the tools provided with the product and can also be used by your own custom JMX code to create, configure, manage, and monitor WebLogic Server resources.

The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a Java EE API that lets the Java clients access remote objects through the use of stubs. It's the object-oriented equivalent of RPC, with support for direct transfer of serialised Java classes and distributed garbage-collection.
