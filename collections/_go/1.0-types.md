## Data Types

Python has the following data types **built-in** by default, in these categories:


Basic Types:
  * Boolean Type: `bool`
  * Numeric Types: `int, float, complex`
Other Built-in Types
  * Text Type: `str`
  * Sequence Types: `list, tuple, range`
  * Mapping Type: `dict`
  * Set Types: `set, frozenset`
  * Binary Types: `bytes, bytearray, memoryview`

### Boolean

Python represents true and false values with the `bool` type.
 There are only two values in this type: `True` and `False`.
  These values can be bound to a variable:

```py
true_variable = True
false_variable = False
```


### Numbers
There are three different kinds of built-in numbers in Python : `ints, floats, and complex`.

#### ints

Integers in Python have arbitrary precision, the amount of digits is limited only by the available memory of the host system.

#### floats

Floating point numbers are usually implemented in Python using a `double in C` (15 decimal places of precision), but will vary in representation based on the host system and other implementation details. This can create some surprises when working with floats, due to the [Floating point](https://0.30000000000000004.com/).
