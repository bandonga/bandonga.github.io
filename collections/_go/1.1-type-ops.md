### Arithmetic

Python fully supports arithmetic between `ints` and `floats`. It will convert narrower numbers to match their less narrow counterparts when used with the binary arithmetic operators `+, -, *, /, //, %`. When division with `/, //` returns the quotient and `%` returns the remainder.

Python considers `ints` narrower than `floats`. So, using a float in an expression ensures the result will be a float too. However, when doing division, the result will always be a float, even if only integers are used.

```python
>>> 3 - 2.0
1.0
# Division always returns a float.
>>> 6 / 2
3.0
# If an int result is needed, you can use `//` to truncate the result.
>>> 7 // 4
1
```

### Convertion

To convert a float to an integer, you can use `int()`. Also, to convert an integer to a float, you can use `float()`.

```python

>>> int(6 / 2)
3
>>> float(1 + 2)
3.0
```
