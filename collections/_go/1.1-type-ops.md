### Type Conversion

Go requires explicit conversion between different types.
Converting between types, **type casting**, is done via a function with the name of the type to convert to (T(v) converts the value v to the type T).

```go
var x int = 42 // x has type int
f := float64(x) // f has type float64 (ie. 42.0)
```

### Arithmetic

Go supports the standard set of arithmetic operators:

```go
+    sum                    // integers, floats, complex values, strings
-    difference             // integers, floats, complex values
*    product                // integers, floats, complex values
/    quotient               // integers, floats, complex values
%    remainder              // integers

&    bitwise AND            // integers
|    bitwise OR             // integers
^    bitwise XOR            // integers
&^   bit clear (AND NOT)    // integers

<<   left shift             // integer << integer >= 0
>>   right shift            // integer >> integer >= 0
```

The `math` package contains many helpful mathematical functions.


#### Arithmetic operations on different types
In many languages you can perform arithmetic operations on different types of variables, but in Go this gives an error:

```go
var x int = 42

// this line produces an error
value := float32(2.0) * x // invalid operation: mismatched types float32 and int

// you must convert int type to float32 before performing arithmetic operation
value := float32(2.0) * float32(x)
```

#### Shorthand Assignments
These can be used in shorthand assignments to update and assign a variable using the operator:

```go
a := 1
a += 2 // same as a = a + 2 == 3
```

#### Increment and Decrement
There are also two special statements: increment (++) and decrement (--) the value by 1.

```go
a := 10
a++ // same as a += 1
```

### logical operators
Go supports three logical operators that can evaluate expressions down to Boolean values, returning either `true` or `false`.

```go
true || false // Output: true
true && false // Output: false
!true // Output: false
```

The three boolean operators each have a different operator precedence. As a consequence, they are evaluated in this order: ! first, && second, and finally ||. If you want to force a different ordering, you can enclose a boolean expression in parentheses (ie. ()), as the parentheses have an even higher operator precedence.

```go
!true && false   // Output: false
!(true && false) // Output: true
```
