## Basic Tools

### Install

Follow the instructions in [go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

```console
## example for amd64 1.20.5
$ wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ $ rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
## add to the rc file
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
$ go version
```

### Hello World

Rust files always end with the `.go` extension.
If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use `MixedCaps or mixedCaps`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Notes about the code:

* `func` is how we declare a function in Rust, the parentheses `()` indicate there are no parameter and  the function body is wrapped in `{}`.
* `main` is the name of a special funtion: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Go program, when you run the main package.
* A package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory.
* Import the `fmt` package, to print to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.
* The line ends with a semicolon `;` which indicates that this expression is over.
* Use tabs for indentation and gofmt emits them by default. Use spaces only if you must.

### Compile and run

```console
$ go run .
Hello, World!
```
