## KEMI

> :information_source: **Note:** Read the [official docs](https://kamailio.org/docs/tutorials/devel/kamailio-kemi-framework) to get the most updated information.

Kamailio Embedded Interface (KEMI) allows you to use various scripting languages to write Kamailio configuration scripts. This flexibility lets you leverage the features and libraries of languages like **Lua, Python** and others, for your SIP server configurations.

> While the native scripting language offers a large set of functions but its limits are met in some cases, especially when in need to integrate with external systems.
> Another missing feature in the native is reloading without a restart.

The main benefits of using KEMI framework:
- Reload of routing scripts without restarting of Kamailio;
- More complete and flexible scripting languages, with larger set of libraries that can be used from the scripting languages;
- Possibility to test the code;

### Interpreter

The KEMI allows the equivalent of **routing** blocks to be written in a different scripting language, as functions.
Each supported language has a **module** that links Kamailio to the scripting interpreter:

```c#
// kamailio.cfg

// global parameters
// module settings

loadmodule <KEMI_MODULE>
modparam(<KEMI_MODULE>, "load", <SCRIPT_PATH>)

cfgengine <KEMI_INTERPERTER>
// routing in <SCRIPT_PATH>
```
#### Functions

Several functions directly to `KSR` module with the format `KSR.function(params)`, , like `KSR.is_myself("sip:127.0.0.1:5060")` which are mostly the main functions from the core and for writing log messages (from `xlog`).

There's also exported functions from modules, with the format `KSR.module.function(params)`  The function name may not be exact since the native configuration allow dynamic arguments, unlike the scripting versions, like `KSR.dispatcher.ds_is_from_list_uri(int groupid, int mode, str "uri")`.

The `KSR.x` submodule provides special functions that need custom code per interpreter.
- `KSR.x.modf(str "fname", params...)` Execute a function, if not available in KSR.
- `KSR.x.exit()` Equivalent of `exit` from native, since the `exit` will exit the app in some languages. Use `return` as an alternative.
- `KSR.x.drop()` Equivalent of `drop` from native kamailio.
