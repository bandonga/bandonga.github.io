### Pre-Processor Directives

> :information_source: **Note:** Read the [official docs](https://www.kamailio.org/wikidocs/cookbooks/devel/core/) to get the most updated information.

Pre-processor directives start with a `#!` or a `!!`, and are evaluated before the execution of the configuration file.
#### include_file

`include_file` - include the content of the file in config before parsing.
The config files can get huge. We can split our code into different files, and organize our routing logic.

```c#
#!include_file extra.cfg
#!import_file extra.cfg // does not throw error if the included file is not found.
```

#### define

`define` is used to define a keyword **ID**, with an optional value.
These IDs can be used set global settings.

```c#
#!define ID       // define an ID
#!define ID VALUE // define an ID with value
#!trydef          // add a define if not already defined
#!redefine        // force redefinition even if already defined
```

> A directive can also be set in as argument, with `kamailio -A ID=VALUE`

#### defenv

`defenv` is similar, but with the define an ID to the value of an **environment variable** with the name of the ENV Variable.

```c#
#!defenv ENVVAR
#!defenv ID=ENVVAR   // define an ID with a different name
#!defenvs ENVVAR     // defenv for strings
#!trydefenv ENVVAR   // will not error if the env variable is not set
#!trydefenvns ENVVAR // trydefenv for strings
```

##### Example

```c#
#!define CODE 200
#!defenvs ENV_HOSTNAME=HOSTNAME
#!defenv KAMA_LISTEN

listen=KAMA_LISTEN
auto_aliases=no

loadmodule "sl"
modparam("sl", "bind_tm", 0)

#!include_file "0.5.0-defines.inc.cfg"
```

```c#
request_route {
  sl_send_reply(CODE, ENV_HOSTNAME);
}
```

We see that:
- The `CODE`  ID is set the response code to the request, `200`.
- The `ENV_HOSTNAME` ID is set with the value of the ENV `HOSTNAME`. Note the `defenvs` sets the value to a string, since that's required for the `sl_send_reply`.
- The `KAMA_LISTEN` is a ENV var that is used by the `listen`, set by `defenv`.
- The routing logic is done a different file, set by `include_file`

**How to test:** Check the [kamalab](/kamailio/kamalab/) to prepare your lab.
```sh
# kamalab ❯
./kamalab
# select 0.5.0-defines.cfg
# Listening on
#              udp: 127.0.0.2 [127.0.0.2]:5060
#              tcp: 127.0.0.2 [127.0.0.2]:5060
# Aliases:
```

In another terminal let's send OPTIONS to the server:
```sh
# >
sipexer 127.0.0.2
# ...
# OPTIONS sip:127.0.0.2:5060 SIP/2.0
# ...
# SIP/2.0 200 desktop.bandonga.com
# ...
```

We can see the response to our request: `200 desktop.bandonga.com`
