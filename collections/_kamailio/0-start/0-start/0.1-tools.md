## kamalab

The goal of this series is to provide practical examples that can be run on your laptop. This Kamailio-by-example lab is called `kamalab`.

I have created a repository with the configurations used in these articles, allowing you to test and switch Kamailio configs quickly.
> [marcelofpfelix/kamalab](https://github.com/marcelofpfelix/kamalab)

```sh
## Requirements
# docker
# fzf
# parallel

## Preparation
git clone git@github.com:marcelofpfelix/kamalab.git ~/git/marcelofpfelix/kamalab
cd ~/git/marcelofpfelix/kamalab

## Running
./kamalab
```

> Kamailio can also be installed from packages or built from sources, following the [official docs](https://www.kamailio.org/wikidocs/#installation).

### How it works
A Docker container starts with a ghcr.io/kamailio image.
This container shares a volume in `/etc/kamailio` and uses the entrypoint to start the `fzf` selected config file: `kamailio -u kamailio -DDE -f /etc/kamailio/${file}`

After that, `parallel` runs 2 tasks:
- tail of docker logs and
- `inotifywait` that restarts kamailio on file changes.

This setup allows you to test different configurations easily and see the results in real-time.

### Tools

##### Client UA
There are many ways to test SIP calls, but these are my favorites:
- [sipp/sipp](https://github.com/SIPp/sipp) for custom messages or scenarios.
- [miconda/sipexer](https://github.com/miconda/sipexer) to send simple sip messages.
- [pjsip/pjproject](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject) the `pjsua` terminal **client**.
- [baresip/baresip](https://github.com/baresip/baresip) a modular terminal **client**.
- [belledonnecommunications/linphone-desktop](https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/linphone-desktop) a desktop **client** if you prefer a GUI or the terminal version [linphonec](https://github.com/BelledonneCommunications/liblinphone/tree/master/console).

##### network
- [irontec/sngrep](https://github.com/irontec/sngrep) TUI sip capture.
- [wireshark/wireshark](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark) and `tshark` for network capture.
