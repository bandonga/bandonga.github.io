## Getting Started: Basic Tools

### Install

Follow the instructions in [python Beginners Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
On most Linux distributions Python comes pre-installed.

```console
## example for debian based distros
$ sudo apt install python3
$ python --version
```

* `python-dev` is the package that contains the header files for the Python C API, which is used by lxml. You need to install, if you are going to compile python extension modules.


### Hello World

Python files always end with the `.py` extension.
If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use `snake case`.

```py
print('Hello, world!')
```

Notes about the code:
* There's no need for a `main` funtion, unlike in C.
* The `print` directive simply prints out a line, unlike in C.
* There's no need for to end the line with a semicolon `;` to indicates that thee expression is over, unlike in C.


### Compile and run

You won't notice a compiler because it runs automatically

```console
$ python hello.py
Hello, world!
```
