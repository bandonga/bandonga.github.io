# BGP


##### Autonomous System (AS)
An autonomous system is a collection of IP address range assignments (prefixes) that are owned by a particular administrative entity, such as a business or individual.

Each registered AS has an assigned autonomous system number (ASN), which uniquely identifies the network on the internet. For example, AS64497 or AS4242424242.

ASNs are assigned by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) such as RIPE or ARIN. You can identify the AS that you're a part of using the Hurricane Electric BGP toolkit.

##### AS Path
The AS path (known as AS_PATH) is the set of unique networks that must be traversed in order to reach a particular destination.

The length of the AS path, meaning the number of 'hops' between one network and another, is one of the key metrics used when deciding the preferred route to a particular network.

##### Prefix
A prefix is an IP address range, referring to the network as a whole rather than any specific host.

For example, 203.0.113.0/24, 192.0.2.0/27 and 172.20.0.0/16 are all network prefixes.

The 'size' of a specific prefix is referred to as the 'prefix length', which is essentially another way of saying subnet mask. A 'long' prefix refers to a more specific network, for example, 172.16.1.0/24 is a longer and more specific prefix than 172.16.0.0/12.

Within BGP, the 'longest' or 'most specific' prefix will always take precedence in routing decisions, no matter the length of the path.

The longest prefix allowed within internet BGP routing tables is generally /24 for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6. This is why it's not possible to announce a /25 IPv4 address range on the internet.

##### Route
A route describes the path or 'next hop' to access a particular network. For example, the following route says that the 203.0.113.0/24 network can be accessed via the router at address 192.0.2.1 using network interface eth0:

203.0.113.0/24 via 192.0.2.1 dev eth0
A particular system or router will usually have a 'routing table', which is essentially a list of known routes. BGP and other routing protocols are used to update and maintain these routing tables.

The 'default route' refers to the route that is used if there isn't an explicit route in place for the destination network. In other words, this is where traffic is sent if the system doesn't know how to reach the destination directly.

##### Neighbour / Peer
BGP neighbours, more commonly known as 'peers', are other routers that you connect to in order to exchange routing information. This is usually configured manually within your BGP daemon, and takes place over TCP port 179 by default.

Making your own prefixes available (routable) to the internet is achieved by 'announcing' or 'advertising' them to your peers, which is one of the primary roles of BGP.

In many setups, you will peer with your upstream network provider(s) in order to announce your own routes and receive theirs (usually to gain access to the wider internet). This is known as External BGP (EBGP).

If you operate a more complex network and are exchanging routing information internally (within the same AS), this is known as Internal BGP (IBGP).

The act of maintaining an active connection to a neighbour is known as 'peering', and each occurrence of this is known as a 'session'.

By default, your router must be on the same subnet as your peer(s) and be able to resolve each of them using ARP. This usually means having a physical link, however a VPN connection or tunnel will also suffice. BGP packets have a TTL of 1 by default, so they will be dropped at the network boundary.

It is possible to BGP peer without a direct connection by using manually-configured static routes and 'multi-hop' mode, however this won't be covered in this series as it is a lesser-used feature.

##### Bogon / Bogon Route
A bogon, also known as a bogon route, is a route that shouldn't be present on the global internet.

For example, erroneous announcements of private IP addresses (such as 192.168.0.0/16), or otherwise reserved address space.

##### Default-free Zone
The default-free zone (DFZ) is the collection of autonomous systems that are able to route any packet without requiring a default route. In other words, they have visibility over the entire internet.

The DFZ primarily consists of large network providers and internet exchange points (known as IXs or IXPs).

# FRR


FRR (Free Range Routing or FRRouting), a fork from Quagga, which is a fork of the Zebra project developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro, is a network routing software suite providing implementations of OSPF, RIP, BGP and IS-IS for Unix-like platforms,

System Architecture
Traditional routing software is made as a one process program which provides all of the routing protocol functionalities. FRR takes a different approach. FRR is a suite of daemons that work together to build the routing table. Each major protocol is implemented in its own daemon, and these daemons talk to a middleman daemon (zebra), which is responsible for coordinating routing decisions and talking to the dataplane.

This architecture allows for high resiliency, since an error, crash or exploit in one protocol daemon will generally not affect the others. It is also flexible and extensible since the modularity makes it easy to implement new protocols and tie them into the suite. Additionally, each daemon implements a plugin system allowing new functionality to be loaded at runtime.

An illustration of the large scale architecture is given below.

|             |   |                  |   |             |
+-------------+   +------------------+   +-------------+
All of the FRR daemons can be managed through a single integrated user interface shell called vtysh. vtysh connects to each daemon through a UNIX domain socket and then works as a proxy for user input. In addition to a unified frontend, vtysh also provides the ability to configure all the daemons using a single configuration file through the integrated configuration mode. This avoids the overhead of maintaining a separate configuration file for each daemon.

FRR is currently implementing a new internal configuration system based on YANG data models. When this work is completed, FRR will be a fully programmable routing stack.

 sudo ip addr add 172.21.77.1 dev lo
  ##You can then manually check the route to ensure that it's a local one:

 ip route get 172.21.77.1
  #This should return something similar to the following:

local 172.21.77.1 dev lo src 172.21.77.1 uid 1000
