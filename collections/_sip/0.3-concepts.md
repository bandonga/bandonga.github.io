## SIP Concepts



**Transaction** - A transaction consists of a Request, any non-final `1XX` Responses received, and a final Response (`199`), as well as the acknowledgments of the Responses (ACK or PRACK), except for ACKs to `2XX` Responses.

**Dialog** - Dialog is a peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two UAs that persists for some time. Is composed by a group of Transactions;
* Dialogs are created through the generation of non-failure responses to requests with specific methods. Only `2XX` and `101-199` responses with a To tag, where the request was INVITE, will establish a dialog;
* A dialog is identified at each UA with a dialog ID, which consists of a `Call-ID` value, a local `FROM` tag and a remote `TO` tag.

**Early-dialog** - A dialog established by a non-final response to a request is in the "early" state and it is called an early dialog.

**Session** - A session is just a media stream (e.g. audio or video) flowing between peers, usually consisting of RTP packets.

Example 1

![sip_transactions1](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&fmt=svg&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandonga/bandonga.github.io/master/assets/puml/sip_transactions1.puml)

Here, (1) to (3) are one transaction. (4) is the second transaction and (5) and (6) constitute third transaction. Together, these three transaction constitute one **dialog**.

Example 2

![sip_transactions1](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&fmt=svg&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bandonga/bandonga.github.io/master/assets/puml/sip_transactions2.puml)

In this example, the messages from (1) to (4) constitute one transaction. This is a "no-dialog" scenario.
