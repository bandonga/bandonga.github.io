Linux is a free and open-source software (FOSS) operating systems built around the Linux kernel, packaged in a distro, by Linus Torvalds.

The main distros for the Enterprise Servers are the Red Hat *RHEL*, SUSE *SLES* (based on Slackware) and *Ubuntu Server* (based on Debian). There is also *Debian* and *Oracle Linux* (based on RHEL, but with Oracle Support).

For desktop, the most common are probably *fedora* or *ubuntu* distros, but there are too many, for different proposes, such as *lubuntu*, that works really well on old computers.
Another worthy mention is the *alpine*, *arch*,  and *gentoo* independent distros. Highly customizable, but recommended only for advanced users.
