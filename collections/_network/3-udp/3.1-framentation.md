### UDP: Frangmentation

#### MTU

There's a limit on the sixe of the frame for carrying the PDU of a protocol in Ethernet, the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), usually 1500 bytes.

If IP is sending a Datagram that is larger than the MTU, IP must fragment it into smaller pieces.

If 2 hosts are across multiple networks, each link can have a different MTU. For example, GRE tunnels require a MTU of 1476 bytes (extra header with 4 bytes).

The **Path MTU** is the smallest MTU of all the links between the source and destination.
The path can change over time, if a router fails, for example and can be non-symmetric (not the same in both directions).

The path MTU discover (PMTUD) is used to determine the largest size of a packet that can be sent without fragmentation, by using ICMP Packet Too Big.

Some firewalls drop ICMP, so PMTUD can fail and cause problems. It can be disabled with `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc=1`.

#### Fragmentation

Frangmentation can be done by the sender or by any intermediate routers (unlike IPv6). Fragments themselves can be fragmented.

The UDP header, with the ports, appears only in the first fragment. This is a firewall/NAT complication, packets can simply be dropped by the network.
The Fragments are controlled by the Identification, Fragment Offset and More Fragments fields in the IP header.

![3.1.0-fragmentation](/assets/images/code/3.1.0-fragmentation.svg)

When sending 3000 bytes of app data (+8+20=3028) fragmentating it in 3 packets is required, with the extra 40 bytes of IP header.
* **Identification:** A unique number for the datagram, usually a counter. It's copied into each fragment and used to group them.
* **Fragment Offset:** The offset of the fragment in the original datagram, in units of 8 bytes (185*8=1480).
* **More Fragments:** Set to 1 in all fragments except the last one.

> If 1 fragment is lost, the whole datagram is lost.
Since fragmentation can occur at any router, there's no way for the sender to know it needs to resend a fragment.

The last argument is delivered first, so the receiving host can assert the max buffer size.
tshark has to reassemble frags to recover the port numbers.

##### Testing

```console
## capture
$ sudo tshark -i any -f "host 192.0.2.1"
    8 25.891998085 192.168.1.196 → 192.0.2.1      IPv4 1516 Fragmented IP protocol (proto=UDP 17, off=0, ID=1fe2)
    9 25.892020193 192.168.1.196 → 192.0.2.1      IPv4 1516 Fragmented IP protocol (proto=UDP 17, off=1480, ID=1fe2)
   10 25.892022837 192.168.1.196 → 192.0.2.1      UDP 37 49166 → 5000 Len=2953
```

```console
## client sends a udp datagram to the server
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=2953 count=1 | nc -q 0 -w 0 -u 192.0.2.1 5000
```

In this example we are using `dd` to generate a random data of 2953 bytes, and send it to the server using `nc` over UDP.
It was send in 3 fragments, the first with 1472, second with 1480 and the last one with 1.
Note that the udp header is only present in the first fragment, so we shouldn't filter by ports.
