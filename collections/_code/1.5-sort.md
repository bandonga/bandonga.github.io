## Sort

### Bubble Sort: `O(N^2)`

Repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed.
  * It will start by comparing index 0 with 1
  * If index 0 is greater than 1, it will swap them
  * Then it will compare index 1 with 2
  * At the end of the first iteration, the largest element will be at the end of the list
  * In the second iteration, we will not include the last element. We will continue until we have no more elements to compare:

```py
  # number of comparations
N
N-1
N-2
...

```
This is a Gauss sum:

```py
N + N-1 + ... + 2 + 1 = N(N+1)/2 -> O(N^2)
```
