## Search

#### Linear Search: `O(N)`

√çt's the simplest search algorithm, a sequential approach to find an element in a list.

```c
int linear_search(int arr[], int n, int x) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (arr[i] == x)
      return i;
  return -1;
}
```

If the array is **ordered** could improve the algorithm by using jumps of `k` elements, instead of `1`. This way, we can reduce the number of comparisons in the worst case from `n` to `n/k`. Let's say 10%:

```
[   10%   20%   ...   90%   ]
                       ^
             9 junps + 0.1N comparisons
```

The worst case is to search for the highest number `(9+0.1N) > O(N)` but better than linear search.

### Binary Search: `O(log N)`

What if we junt by 50%?

```
[(0)                (50)                ]
        is v > N/2?: No
[         (25)      (50)                ]
   is v > N/4?: Yes
```

So it's doing `N/2, N/4,...` until it searches until `N/2^k = 1` => `k = log N`


> If it halves at each step, it's likely `O(log N)` or `O(N log N)`.

Code:

```c
int binarySearch(int arr[], int rg, int x) {
  int m, lf = 0;

  while (lf < rg) {
    m = lf + (rg - lf) / 2;
    // Check if x is present at mid
    if (arr[m] == x)
      return m;
    // If x greater, ignore left half
    else if (arr[m] > x)
      rg = m;
    // If x is smaller, ignore right half
    else
      lf = m - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}
```
