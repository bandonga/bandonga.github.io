## Basic Tools

> :information_source: **Note:** Read the [offical docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) to get the most updated information.

### install

Follow `rustup` instructions in [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
$ rustc --version
## update
$ rustup update
```

In the Rust development environment, all tools are installed to the `~/.cargo/bin` directory, and this is where you will find the Rust tools.
`rustup` will include this directory to the `PATH` environment variable.


### Hello World

Rust files always end with the `.rs` extension.
If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use `snake_case`.

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Notes about the code:

* `fn` is how we declare a function in Rust, the parentheses `()` indicate there are no parameter and  the function body is wrapped in `{}`.
* `main` is the name of a special funtion: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
* The line `println!()` uses a *macro*. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as println (without the `!`).
* The line ends with a semicolon `;` which indicates that this expression is over.
* Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.

### Compile and run

```console
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```
Similar to gcc, rustc will produce a binary file called `main`.
