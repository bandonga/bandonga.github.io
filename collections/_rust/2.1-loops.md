## Control Flow: Loops

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop, while, for`.


### loop

The `loop` *keyword* creates an infinite loop.

```rs
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
```

You might also need to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code.
To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the loop

```rs
    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
```
