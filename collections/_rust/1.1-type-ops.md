### Type Operations

#### Arithmetics

Basic mathematical operations youâ€™d expect for all the number types:

```rs
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1
    // Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

[Appendix B](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/appendix-02-operators.html) contains a list of all operators that Rust provides.
