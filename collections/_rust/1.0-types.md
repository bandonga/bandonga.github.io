## Data Types


Rust doesn't do any implicit type **conversion**. In cases when many types are possible we must add a type **annotation**, like this: `: u32`

```rs
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

* When converting from a larger type to a smaller one (for instance `u64` to `u32`) you could lose data.
* Converting from a floating point to an integer **will** lose everything behind the decimal point, effectively rounding down.


Rust has two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

### Scalar Types: Basic Types

A *scalar* type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: `(integers, floating-point) Numbers, Booleans, and characters`.

#### Booleans

```rs
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
```

#### Characters

```rs
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

* specify `char` literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.
* `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value.


#### Integer Numbers

Numbers without a fractional component.

```yml
Length:  Signed	Unsigned
8-bit:   i8     u8
16-bit:  i16    u16
32-bit:  i32    u32
64-bit:  i64    u64
128-bit: i128   u128
arch:    isize  usize # 64 bits if youâ€™re on a 64-bit architecture
                  # and 32 bits if youâ€™re on a 32-bit architecture
```

You can write integer **literals** in

```yml
Decimal: 98_222 # _ is visual separator of 98222
Hex: 0xff
Octal: 0o77
Binary: 0b1111_0000
Byte: b'A' # u8 only
```

Number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type.
`integer` types default to `i32` (e.g when indexing some sort of collection).


> :warning: **Note:** If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, integer **overflow** will occur:
>   * When youâ€™re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to panic at runtime if this behavior occurs.
>   * When youâ€™re compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does not check it. Instead, Rust performs twoâ€™s complement wrapping: values greater than the maximum value the type can hold *"wrap around"* to the minimum of the values the type can hold.

#### Floating-Point Numbers

Numbers with decimal points (IEEE-754 Standard) e.g. `97.51` , has two primitive types: `f32` and `f64` (default).
